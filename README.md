# JS311_CP2_medReminder

My capstone project centers around creating an app for medication reminders. This app is primarily focused for mobile use, but should still be accessed by any other device including a computer or tablet. 
A window alert will pop up outside the app (so on a phone, an alert should come up to remind a user to take their medication). Once signed in to the app, going passed a login page, the user will go to the home page. On the home page, the alert will be there; and, once a user has taken their medication, the user is required to toggle the notification switch so that a log can be created. The purpose of this is so the user knows that they have taken their meds. Once toggled the alert disappears and a log entry is created. A user can set up their information on a profile page (They will need a username, password, first name, last name, DOB, phone, and email). There will be a page where they can put in the medication they take with the dosage, times of day they need the alerts, and can look up additional information about their medication which will direct them to an API with information provided by the FDA. 
There will be a page that has a log of the medication they have taken and when they've taken it. If they've skipped a dose it will log that as well.
